            For the 1<sup>st</sup> The book says, 2005<sub>23</sub> CO<sub>2</sub> <q>Snakes eat the whole animal. And they sleep for six months</q>.
            I think about the life in the forest. <i>I make my first picture</i>. This is my picture number one.
            I show my fantastic picture to one person. And I ask this person, <q>Are you scared?</q>
            This person answers, <q>How can I be scared? It is a hat</q>.
            My picture is not a picture of a hat. It is a picture of a big snake. <cite>An elephant</cite> is inside the snake. 
            Then I make my picture number two. The picture shows the inside of the big snake. Now people understand. 
            This is my picture number two.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>People tell me what they think.</b> They tell me that it is not good to make pictures. They tell me that it is better to study geography, 
            history, maths and grammar. After these words, I don’t want to make pictures. I don’t want to make pictures because my picture number one 
            and picture number two are not good for the people. People don’t understand simple things.
            And now, I am not a child.

            <blockquote cite="https://www.youtube.com/">
            <p>I am a big person. I have a job. I am a pilot.</p>
            </blockquote> 

            <p>I show him my picture number one. <q>I always have this picture with me</q></p>

            <br/>

            <b>I want to know</b> if this person understands life. But the person always says, 
            <q>It is a hat</q>. Then I never speak to this person about big snakes or forests or stars. 
            And <abbr title="Information Technology Engineering"> ITE</abbr>, sport and family. 
            <acronym title="Information Technology Engineering">ITE</acronym> 
            And the person is happy. For him I am a normal man.
